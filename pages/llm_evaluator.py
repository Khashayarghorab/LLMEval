### 📜 How It Works
This is an LLM-based evaluation system that compares a multi-agent system (Dragonshield) against a single-agent system (JSA Advisor) for Job Safety Analysis (JSA) of construction tasks. 
The system will:

1. Use Dragonshield (multi-agent system) to conduct a comprehensive JSA
2. Use JSA Advisor (single-agent system) to conduct a JSA
3. Compare and evaluate both approaches
4. Generate an impartial judgment on which system performed better

### ⚙️ Setup
Please provide your OpenAI API key to use this tool. Your API key is required to run the LLM agents.
